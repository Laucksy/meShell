meShell can be built using the provided Makefile. The make commands are:

compile - create an executable in the /src folder with the needed linked libraries
clean - remove the executable from the /src folder
install - compiles the executable, moves the executable to /install/bin, gzips the
	  man page, copies the man page to /install/man/man1

The man page can be viewed from the root directory of meShell using the following command:
	man -l install/man/man1/meShell.1.gz

If the readline C library is not already installed on your machine, it must be installed with the following:
	sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev
